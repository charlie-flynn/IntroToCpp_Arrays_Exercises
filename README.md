# IntroToCpp_Arrays_Exercises

hello eveorybody welcome to my array exercises. to use programs 1-5, you look at what happens, type in your thoughts and concerns into the console, and then press enter. i will not hear your thoughts and concerns through the console though. that's between you and the computer.

however. program 6 is special. you can click on the squares that appear randomly on the screen and they will change colors! it's really cool i think. there is no way to input your thoughts and concerns here, sadly.
